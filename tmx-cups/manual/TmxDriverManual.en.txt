Port setting is required if port other than USB is used. 
Please execute one of the following port setting tools depending on the 
situation:
  - /usr/sbin/tmportconfig  Menu based port setting tool
  - /usr/sbin/tmpcsconfig   Command line based port setting tool
For USB, the port will be added automatically by PnP function when the 
device is connected while during online. So usually port setting isn't 
needed.

Note)
  ! You need root privileges for port settings.
  ! Turn the printer off while setting the port.

8. Transmission function for a user-defined file
---------------------------------------------------------------------


8.1. Overview

    An ESC/POS command file created by a user is called a 
    user-definition file. Placing a user-defined file at the 
    designated location enables the user to transmit command data in 
    the file to the printer at a fixed timing for each page or job.


8.2. Transmission timing and naming conventions for the user-defined 
     file

    File storage folder: /var/lib/tmx-cups/
    
    Naming convention            | Transmission timing
---------------------------------+-----------------------------------
    {printer_name}_StartJob.prn  | When starting to print (after 
                                 | initializing the printer)
    {printer_name}_EndJob.prn    | After printing (before cutting the 
                                 | document)
    {printer_name}_StartPage.prn | When starting to print each page
                                 | (after initializing the page)
    {printer_name}_EndPage.prn   | After printing a page (before 
                                 | cutting the page)

    The printer_name indicates the registered printer name to CUPS.

    Example) When the registered printer name is tmtprinter and you
             want to output a logo at the beginning, register the
             following file.

             /var/lib/tmx-cups/tmtprinter_StartJob.prn

    Note)
    ! You need root privilege to store the user-defined file in 
      /var/lib/tmx-cups/.
    ! Grant the appropriate permissions to the user-defined file 
      according to its function. Transmission is not carried out if 
      the printing user does not have read permission to the 
      user-defined file.
    ! The printer may malfunction if the user-defined file contains 
      any graphic commands whose pattern matches real-time commands.
    ! If a user-defined file is stored in any of the subordinate 
      directories, uninstallation of this package does not delete the
      directory which contains the file. 


8.3. Printing text data

    You can print the text data if the user-defined file under 
    /var/lib/ contains text data.

    Example) When tmtprinter_StartJob.prn contains the following
             line of text data.
    ======
    Welcome!

    ======
    The above text is printed each time you print from tmtprinter 
    at the top of the print job.


    Note)
    ! The text data may not be printed correctly if the specified 
      character code is other than ASCII.
    ! Use <LF>(0x0A) for a line feed.
      Printing operations are not guaranteed if <CR>(0x0D) is used.
    ! The text data may not be printed correctly if a line feed <LF> 
      is not present at the end of a line.
    ! Don't include paper handling commands such as <FF>(0x0C), or
      the printer may malfunction.
    ! The printing result is not guaranteed if the user-defined file 
      is edited or deleted while printing.
      Do not change the user-defined file until printing is complete. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------
9. Multi-tone conversion tool
---------------------------------------------------------------------


9.1 Overview

    This tool converts an image file into ESC/POS command data.
    You can use this tool to print multi-tone graphic data in 
    a TM/BA series thermal printer with the ability of printing 
    multi-tone graphic data.
    Also, you can print a logo by registering the converted
    command data file in the folder where user-defined files are 
    stored.


9.2 Installation destination and the command name

    /usr/bin/tmbmptobin


9.3 Tool options

    Syntax: tmbmptobin [option] input_BMP_file   output_BIN_file

    Options (default settings are in [])
        [-16s], -2s                 Multi-tone, Monochrome
        [-left], -center, -right    Printing position
        -b65 to [-b100] to -b135    Brightness (in 5 units)
        -r180                       Rotation by 180 degrees
        [-80mm], -58mm              Paper width 80mm or 58mm
        [-180dpi], -203dpi          Resolution 180dpi or 203dpi
        [-h80] to -h415             Band Lines 80 to 415
        
  Note)
    ! Multi-tone option can be used only for the TM/BA series thermal 
      printers that can print multi-tone graphic data. (Ex: TM-T88V)
    ! The tool supports Windows BMP files only.
      Uncompressed 1-bit, 4-bit, 8-bit, and 24-bit BMP files are 
      supported.
    ! Take care that the image size does not exceed the maximum printable 
      width of the printer.
      The image is not printed if it exceeds the maximum printable width.
      Ex) When using 80mm paper, resolution 180dpi: 510 pixels or less


9.4 Logo registration

    You can insert a log in the print page by registering a binary 
    file, which has been created by converting an image file into 
    command data, into the folder where user-defined files are 
    stored.
    See "8. Transmission function for a user-defined file" for 
    details.


9.5 Coupon file printing

    The following prints an image file such as a coupon promptly. 

    Example) When the registered printer name is tmtprinter.
    ======
    # tmbmptobin  imagedata.bmp  /var/lib/tmx-cups/tmtprinter_StartJob.prn
    # echo "" | lpr -P tmtprinter
    =====

  Note)
    ! The above overwrites tmtprinter_StartDocStartJob.prn if the 
      file is already registered.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
10. How to Uninstall
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The following describes how to uninstall this software.

  - Change directory where the installation package expanded,
    and execute uninstall.sh shell script.
    # ./uninstall.sh
